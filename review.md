SAMSUNG GALAXY Z FOLD 3
Samsung has continued to be at the forefront of this device category, polishing what is now its third iteration of a tablet-sized foldable, a device that opens like a book to reveal a large internal screen.
So the Z Fold 3 is basically a better built version of the Fold 2 and it's priced at 48,990 CZK now. So it's still an expensive specialty phone, but with serious ambition.
As before, each half of the phone has a full metal frame that attaches to the hinge mechanism in the middle. The two outer glass panels have been upgraded to Corning Gorilla Glass Victus, the company’s most shatter-proof material yet. The glass is curved along the edges where it tucks into the metal frame. This helps smooth out the profile of the phone to a small degree.
The Fold wants to be as close to a normal smartphone as possible, but then also give you a huge sort of mini tablet sized screen and all the experiences that are great about that And so I actually think that because the phone's ambition is so high, this phone, the Fold 3 is actually worse at some normal phone things, on its way to doing some things that no other phone can do.
What is impressive is it’s water resistance rating standing at an IPX8 which makes this the first water resistant foldable phone.

DISPLAY:
The cover screen on the Fold 3, it is better than ever. It's way better than the first Fold. It's 120 Hertz now, plenty bright, and you can use it as a normal phone for quick stuff when you don't really feel like opening the whole thing up, but it's pretty narrow. It's a very tall aspect ratio that makes the top pretty difficult to reach. Watching videos on it isn't great. Again, because it's so narrow. The keyboard on the cover screen is a little cramped. It's very easy to make a lot of typos trying to hit those tiny buttons. So it's just not the shape of a normal phone.
The top protective layer over the folding glass is 30% harder from it’s predecessor, which, maybe that's a little deceiving. Like it sounds pretty nice on paper, but fundamentally it's still very soft. It still has to fold in half. So it absolutely will still take permanent damage from accidental fingernails and anything harder than a normal finger screen press. This is not a normal screen still. 
It's still a bleeding edge, very new display technology.

PERFORMANCE:
The Galaxy Z Fold 3 has one of the best chips from Qualcomm in addition to a reasonable allotment of RAM and fast UFS 3.1 storage. It runs in the top circle of mobile devices out there
Daily performance of the Z Fold 3 is absolutely fine. The regular experience of using the phone for normal smartphone stuff demonstrates no issues with respect to speed or performance. The huge package of RAM allows the phone to run multiple apps at a time with no problem, no hesitation, no issue. Dragging content from window to window was always smooth and clean and there was no stuttering or hanging. Demanding games ran perfectly.


CAMERA:
The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 has five cameras. It packs a standard arrangement on the rear with main, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses, in addition to a user-facing camera on the front of the phone as well as the under-display camera that’s built into the screen. These give you plenty of options for capturing photos.
The selfie camera is a four megapixel sensor, behind the glass and the display panel hidden by a pixelated array. And it's decently hidden in most cases where you're not really looking for it,

CONCLUSION:
The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 is a stellar device that capitalizes well on the lack of competition. No other phone offers the polished foldable experience that's available from the Z Fold 3.
